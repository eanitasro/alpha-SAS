1. File "shape+pddf+SAS_for_data_from_atomic_coordinates.nb" performs the steps: 3, 9, 10, 11 and part of step 12 described in the paper.
2. File "contrast_matching_RBD+Sb23.nb" allows determination of contrast-matching point of RBD+Sb23 complex and the forward intensity I(0), i.e. part of step 12 and step 13 in the paper.
3. File "Stuhrmann_plot_RBD+Sb23.nb" allows determination of contrast-matching point for RBD+Sb23 complex, i.e. step 14 in the paper.
4. File "contrast_matching_KinA+Sda.nb" allows determination of contrast-matching point of KinA+Sda complex and the forward intensity I(0), i.e. part of step 12 and step 13 in the paper.
5. File "Stuhrmann_plot_KinA+Sda.nb" allows determination of contrast-matching point for KinA+Sda complex, i.e. step 14 in the paper.
